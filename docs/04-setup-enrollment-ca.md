this CA is used to generate (through a process called “enrollment”) the certificates of the admin of an organization, the MSP of that organization, and any nodes owned by that organization. This CA will also generate the certificates for any additional users. Because of its role in “enrolling” identities, this CA is sometimes called the “enrollment CA” or the “ecert CA”.
